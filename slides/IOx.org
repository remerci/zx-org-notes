#+TITLE: IOx

* supported Router

  Cisco networked devices such as our CGR 1120, 1240, 819 ISR and even some of our Video Surveillance Cameras.

  IOx works by hosting applications in a *Guest Operating System (GOS)* running in a hypervisor directly on the *Connected Grid Router (CGR)*. This allows you to run your Python or even compiled code where it matters most: at the network edge. By default, the CGR comes packaged with *Yocto Linux*, but you can replace that image with your own Operating System.
